            <p>Question, everyone. Show of hands: who here has used marijuana &lt;<em>I raise my hands</em>&gt; (don’t worry, you don’t have to raise your hands)? Another show of hands: who here has ripped someone off who was trying to buy marijuana &lt;<em>I raise my hands again</em>&gt;?</p>
<p>I’ve told a version of this story to friends after college, for my original lit to the Washington Society, to coworkers at a workshop after a bottle of wine, to my federal investigator during my initial security clearance interview. I’ve cleaned up some of the language because we’re all living in times more enlightened than when I was still growing up, and I should know better.</p>
<p>Seven months before the story, it’s my 21st birthday. For many, it’s drinking too much and sometimes waking up not knowing where you got there. If you’re white, you’re probably waking up at Panera Bread. My 21st was a bit different: my roommate and friend decided that marijuana was the best birthday present I could get. He was right! $300 in three full bags of marijuana makes me happy and popular! Eating the rest of the evidence on my flight back to Richmond a few days later gave me the calmest plane ride I’ve ever had!</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, I got an email out of the blue from Some guy on early Sunday morning, April 9, 2000. I guess he heard about my birthday party. It went something like this.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey,I hear you're a stoner now...Think you could hook me and my roommate up?</p>
<p>Some guy</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first">I then replied to him something ridiculous. I didn't actually think he would actually think I was serious, and that I had some weed. But oh well...</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Come by at 2 PM on Sunday, this Sunday. I will have so much weed that you'll fart out your ears.</p>
<p>Tanim</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Then some guy took my message seriously. What presumption — even though I was a pothead, I don’t want some rando to peg me as one and ask for weed out of the blue! At first, I was angry at him, showing my email correspondence with Some guy to my roommate at the time, as a joke suggested that I give him oregano as &quot;weed.&quot; But then, I thought, what a good idea! So he and I went to that organic supermarket on California Blvd, where we got one oregano shaker and a small pack of ziplock bags, all for ~$5.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I sent the following message shown below, just before my roommate and I left for the supermarket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come by this Sunday, 2 PM, at the Ruddock library.</p>
<p>&gt; Cool, but where are you?  Also, I won't have time to get too high on</p>
<p>&gt; Sunday cause I have two problem sets due tomorrow, but can I buy some to take home with me?</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; Some guy</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="4">
<li><p class="first">We started a really stupid email exchange, because obviously Some guy was very nervous about getting caught.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, sure, you can buy some. It's sitting around here right now, waiting for you. Just reply if you got this email.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll come by at 2 to buy some.  Still want to meet at the library right?</p>
<p>Some guy</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Yeah. The library. Let's not email anymore. People might think we're XXXX &lt;make grunting sounds&gt;.</p>
<p>Tanim</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some guy arrived with his roommate, pretty much on time. The two who were &quot;busy with two problem sets&quot; were really &quot;fiending&quot; for some weed, among other things. Well, right before he arrived, my roommate and I noticed that the &quot;eighth&quot; of &quot;weed&quot; really smelled like oregano. One bag wasn't enough to cover the smell, so we scrounged for an extra ziplock bag to cover it up. There were many flaws in our plan.</p>
<p>Plus, a group of people from both floors were congregating...some thought some guy wouldn't be stupid as to forget checking if the weed was real. I was getting kinda nervous -- I didn't want a scene. As I mentioned, I had a reputation to keep as a &quot;drug dealer&quot; who operates out of the Ruddock Library, in plain view of everyone.</p>
<p>Some guy and his friend arrived. He asked in a very low voice if I &quot;had the weed on me.&quot; Well, I just got an eighth of weed out of my pocket, and he quickly snatched the weed into his pocket. Remember, people were studying in the library while the drug deal was going down. He gave me the $25 I asked. But then he said that his roommate could pay up to $75 for his drugs, and some guy could pay about $70, for something like $145 for both. We then walked by my room, where he asked -- he practically begged -- for more drugs.</p>
<p>He asked if he could have more weed, up to the $145 for more drugs, like LSD. I told him that I don't really know what kind of weed I had, that my roommate the dealer hooked me up with whatever he had lying around. I told him that right now we had Red Sasparilla and Green Firecracker -- it didn't matter since I was talking out of my butt. My marijuana habit, up to the time I quit, was called “smoke whatever your friends can find.” I also told him that I didn't carry LSD or Ecstasy &quot;right now,&quot; but something like &quot;your comments are important to me, and I'll make sure I get you the drugs you so definitely need and deserve, as expeditiously as possible.&quot; Of course, I wasn't that blatant, what with being afraid that he'd trip me up and catch me. I was surprised he didn't notice the weed was double-bagged!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, we walked pretty slowly out of Ruddock, him talking in a low voice, my talking a little louder than usual. He really, really, really wanted his LSD, crank, weed, Ecstasy, and what-not. I wished him well, saying that I &quot;...probably wouldn't have any new stuff by Wednesday, but I'm sure I'd get something by Saturday at the latest.&quot; Also, the stuff I got would be &quot;whatever my dealer had on hand, so no promises.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, my plan was (if he was stupid enough) was that NEXT weekend my DEALER (or, my roommate) would &quot;transact&quot; the drug business, for anything up to and including 150 dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="6">
<li><p class="first">Here, some guy and friend get angry. To me, he says the following, about 30 minutes after the deal went down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck is this shit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then after talking about the incident with everyone around me, I decided to treat myself and the mutual friend to Baja Fresh. Walking out of the Ruddock parking lot, one of my friends rushed up to me. Some guy is also a friend of my friend. To my friend, he has this gigantic online chat (or diatribe, I can't tell which), about how I'm so sketchy, so scummy, and how he'll report me to the police and/or the Board of Control, my college’s version of the Honor Council (about how I took &quot;advantage&quot; of him, or something like that). But the funniest thing, that thing I will remember for as long as I live, is that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...I smoked something like FOUR BOWLS of this stuff, and either this shit is oregano or the weakest fucking weed in the history of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess he didn't notice that the SMELL of the weed is overpowering, like OREGANO, or that his weed TASTES like OREGANO.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Yet another friend of mine suggested this reply; I can’t take credit, but a good idea is a good idea!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck are you talkin' about? I got high as a mutherfuck off that shit!! And don't blame me, man, I get it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>Hey, but anyways, you should dip this in liquid Drano and roll it up in toilet paper. I've never done this, but I hear that shit will really fuck you up.</p>
<p>Peace, Brutha</p>
</blockquote>
