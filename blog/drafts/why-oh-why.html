            <p>The only thing that would seem to help is to get into a stable committed
romantic relationship, someone who can help to heal me. But the issues
that I haven't been able to handle makes me completely and horridly
paranoid about other people and how they might treat me. I am so
emotionally vulnerable that I snap into a ball at the slightest hint,
real or otherwise, of rejection.
Hooked up with a friend of my sister's on Thu. night. God, for a while
it felt so good and fine. Things like this are my current, deeply
unstable and dissatisfying forays into female interactions and sex. I
hate random hook-ups and one-night stands. But I am so unimaginably
starved for true affection, and any scrap of feeling that the world is
not an utterly awful place filled with people who will in the end betray
me, that I will drink the emotional equivalent of turpentine and
sulfuric acid if it would only help to sate this hunger for a few
moments.
And always, the seductive thought (oh so sweet, relatively speaking)
that maybe it was all a mistake. That life was so much easier when I had
few friends (and by friend, I mean someone who I talked to for a few
hours every few months in a nonprofessional fashion), when I worked 13+
hour days 7 days in a week and usually slept in the office, when I
always felt like shit, when I could go through each and every day
forever because I had no hope that the future would ever be an inviting
place for me. Why should I? I had lived the life I had, had experienced
the pain I had, and such horrible shit happened to me especially when I
was an unconditionally good person or did unconditionally good things.
Perhaps I wasn't fully human, perhaps I was God's own pincushion, and so
I deserved it.
My sister rebelled, and I was always so insanely jealous that she had
this kind of freedom. I could never be as free with my emotions, because
there was always the fear that I would get even more deeply hurt. It
took all my willpower, and what can best be described as emotional
anesthesia, to just take in all these toxins and bury them in my frozen
heart. Sure, my psyche was infected, but it was frozen and barricaded
enough that not much could have happened. Not much did happen. Only
started dating and having &quot;relationships,&quot; after a fashion, in 2003.
Being praised for being so nice and well-mannered and studious and
hard-working and brilliant and not at all like the other kids became one
of the most unintentionally poisonous insults that people told me, and
it's bite is still acidic, still incredibly corrosive. I had to suppress
so much of my humanity that I almost forgot what it was like to feel a
bond with people around me, to almost forget the endless scream tearing
through my insides, in order to do these things. And better yet, to do
these things even when there was so much pressure and temptation to
snap. How could I work days and days on end, with this sort of
punishment and loneliness my one and final reward? Because it was
easier, far easier, to deal with a pain that helped to dull me than to
address even one of the issues that had so fully colored my psyche.
I suppose one event, during my time as a grad student at MIT, could help
to explain. I had just been working 11 hours straight on a Saturday, I
think from 10 AM until 9 PM (this was a pretty normal experience for
me), and decided to go to Dunkin' Donuts for a food break by myself. I
met a homeless woman there who, even though she was living on the street
and had nothing to her name, could count on some support from her women
friends and her remaining family. I told her about my life -- the fact
that I don't have time for a social life because all I do is research,
that on Sundays I run errands and cook meals for the rest of the week,
that if I am lucky I get the luxury of seeing two movies in a single
month, and that I was grateful to get even this much because &quot;at least
now I could sleep eight hours a day if I wanted to.&quot; Do you know what
she told me?
&quot;This is one of the saddest things I have ever heard. I really feel
sorry for you.&quot;]]&gt;</p>
